# TOKENCREATION_MOD3
ERC-20 Token Contract 
Introduction
This repository contains the Solidity smart contract for an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is created following the ERC-20 standard and includes functionality for basic token operations such as minting, transferring, and burning.

Token Details
Token Name: [Your Token Name]
Token Symbol: [Your Token Symbol]
Total Supply: [Total Supply of Tokens]
Contract Functionality
The ERC-20 Token Contract includes the following functions:

constructor: The constructor function initializes the contract and mints the initial supply of tokens to the contract creator.

mint: This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and allocate them to a specified address.

transferTokens: Users can call this function to transfer tokens from their address to another address on the network.

burnTokens: Users can burn their own tokens to reduce the total supply.

balanceOf: This function allows users to check the balance of tokens in a specific address.

allowance: This function returns the amount of tokens that another address is allowed to spend on behalf of the sender.

approve: This function allows a user to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf.

transferFrom: This function allows an approved address to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the owner.

Deployment and Interaction
To deploy and interact with the ERC-20 Token Contract, you can follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and Hardhat installed.

Deployment: Use the Hardhat deployment script (deploy.js) to deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network.

Interact with the Contract: You can use tools like Remix, MyEtherWallet, or web3.js to interact with the deployed contract. Send transactions from Ethereum addresses to call the contract functions.
